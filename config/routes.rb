Rails.application.routes.draw do

    # When we receive a `GET` request with URL `/about`, then Rails will invoke
    # the `about_controller` with `index` action (action is just a method that is
    # defined within a controller)
    get('/about', { to: 'about#index' })
    # get '/about', to: 'about#index'

    # you can also write it as:
    # get('/about' => 'about#index')

    # if you don't pass an `as:` option then Rails will attempt to generate a URL
    # / PATH helper for you. If you pass the `as:` option then Rails will use
    # that as the URL/PATH helper. The auto generated path helper will be
    # `contact_us_path` while after we added the `as:` option, it will just be
    # `contact_path`
    get('/contact_us', { to: 'contact#new', as: 'contact' })
    # get '/contact_us', => 'contact#new', as: 'contact'

    post('/contact', { to: 'contact#create', as: 'contact_submit' })



    # this will make the home page of the application go to WelcomeController with
    # index action
    root 'welcome#index'
