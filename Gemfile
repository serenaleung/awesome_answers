# this file is used by the bundler gem to know which gems are needed for this
# project (the Rails project). You can install or update the gems by running
# `bundle install` or simply `bundle` in your terminal in the root of the
# project. You don't need to use `require 'rails'` or use `require` for any
# other gem definded in this Gemfile because bundler is going to auto
# require all the gems defined in this file (the Gemfile)

# Once you run `bundle` or `bundle install`, bundler will automatically update
# the `Gemfile.lock` file. The `Gemfile.lock` will `lock` the gem to a specific
# version. This is important so all developers working on the project end up
# using the same exact Ruby version for this project. You should never modify
# `Gemfile.lock` directly (unless there is Git conflict in it)

# if you have the gem installed in your ruby it will just be use,d otherwise
# bundler will install that gem for you
