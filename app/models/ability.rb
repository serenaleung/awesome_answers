class Ability
  include CanCan::Ability

  # CanCanCan will sutomatically initialize with every request to your controllers.
  # It assumes that you have a method available to the controllers
  # called `current_user` and it will automatically initialize an `Ability`
  # object with `current_user` passed to it.

  def initialize(user)
    # as per comments above `user` here refers to `current_user`

    # if the user isn't logged in, which means `user` comes as `nil`, then `user`
    # will be assigned to `User.new`. This is useful so we don't have to check if
    # `user` is `nil` all the time
    user ||= User.new

    if user.is_admin?
      # this gives the admin user super powers by enabling them to perform any
      # action on any model
      can :manage, :all
    end

    # in this ex. we're saying that the user can edit a question if the user
    # is the owner (creator) of that question
    can [:edit, :destroy], Question do |question|
      question.user == user
    end

    # OR
    # `user_id` is inside the `questions` table and `user` is either the signed
    # in user (if the user is signed in) or `User.new` as per line 14
    # can :edit, Question, user_id: user.id

    # Define abilities for the passed in user here. For example:
    #
    #   user ||= User.new # guest user (not logged in)
    #   if user.admin?
    #     can :manage, :all
    #   else
    #     can :read, :all
    #   end
    #
    # The first argument to `can` is the action you are giving the user
    # permission to do.
    # If you pass :manage it will apply to every action. Other common actions
    # here are :read, :create, :update and :destroy.
    #
    # The second argument is the resource the user can perform the action on.
    # If you pass :all it will apply to every resource. Otherwise pass a Ruby
    # class of the resource.
    #
    # The third argument is an optional hash of conditions to further filter the
    # objects.
    # For example, here the user can only update published articles.
    #
    #   can :update, Article, :published => true
    #
