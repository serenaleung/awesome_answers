<h1>New Question</h1>
<%# form_for is a built-in Rails helper that enables us to generate a form form
    an ActiveRecrod model to submit to the associated controller. If you pass in
    a non-persisted ActiveRecord object (not in the DB yet) then `form_for` will
    automatically assume that this form will submit to the `create` action in
    the associated controller (in our case questions#create) which has a path
    helper of `questions_path` so we must have `questions_path` defined
    If `@question` has values set to it already then the form will be
    prepopulated with those values. %>

<%= @question.errors.full_messages.join(', ') %>
<%= form_for @question do |f| %>
  <div>
    <%= f.label :title %>
    <%= f.text_field :title %>
  </div>
  <div>
    <%= f.label :body %>
    <%= f.text_area :body %>
  </div>
  <%= f.submit %>
<% end %>
