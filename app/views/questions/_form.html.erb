<%# form_for is a built-in Rails helper that enables us to generate a form form
    an ActiveRecrod model to submit to the associated controller. If you pass in
    a non-persisted ActiveRecord object (not in the DB yet) then `form_for` will
    automatically assume that this form will submit to the `create` action in
    the associated controller (in our case questions#create) which has a path
    helper of `questions_path` so we must have `questions_path` defined
    If `@question` has values set to it already then the form will be
    prepopulated with those values. %>


<%# if you pass a pesisted ActiveRecord object to the `form_for` (in the DB)
    then `form_for` will submit a `PATCH` request (instead of POST) using a
    hidden_field technique and the URL for the form will be in the case the
    `update` action url which is in our case question_path(@question) %>

  <%= @question.errors.full_messages.join(', ') %>
  <%= form_for @question do |f| %>
    <div>
      <%= f.label :title %>
      <%= f.text_field :title %>
    </div>
    <div>
      <%= f.label :body %>
      <%= f.text_area :body %>
    </div>
    <div class="form-group">
      <%= f.collection_select :tag_ids, Tag.order(:name), :id, :name,
                              {}, #options,
                              { multiple: true, class: 'chosen-select form-control' } %>
    </div>
    <%= f.submit %>
  <% end %>
