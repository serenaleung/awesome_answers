<%# we will need to re-render the form in case there has been previous errors
    displayed on it. However, the form expects us to have `@answer` defined to
    a new Answer but it's currently defined an answer that is already persisted
    in the database (saved already) so we will need to re-initialize the answer
    to a new `Answer` %>
<% @answer = Answer.new %>
$('#new_answer').replaceWith('<%= j render 'form' %>');
